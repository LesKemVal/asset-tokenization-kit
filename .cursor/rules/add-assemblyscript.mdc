## Project Structure
- keep pure computation in helpers and avoid stateful globals
- separate type adapters for Bytes, Address, and BigInt conversions

## Code Style
- avoid heap allocations in tight loops and reuse temporary objects
- prefer static methods and pure functions to help the compiler

## Usage
- convert between ethereum types carefully and avoid lossy casts
- prefer array methods that do not allocate when possible
