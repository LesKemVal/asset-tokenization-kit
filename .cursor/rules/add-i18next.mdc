## Project Structure
- organize namespaces by feature and load via lazy bundles
- keep translation keys typed with resources and avoid string unions scattered

## Code Style
- prefer useTranslation with keyPrefix in leaf components
- avoid dynamic keys where possible and centralize plurals and interpolation

## Usage
- preload critical namespaces during routing and use Suspense for translations
- ensure locale persistence and direction are handled at the document root
