## Project Structure
- create a custom render with app providers and reuse across tests
- colocate fixtures and mock handlers next to tests

## Code Style
- query by role and accessible name as the primary strategy
- avoid snapshots for dynamic UI and assert meaningful user visible outcomes

## Usage
- simulate user flows with user event and avoid fireEvent except for low level cases
- prefer findBy queries for async UI and use waitFor when polling is required
