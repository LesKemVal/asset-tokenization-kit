You are an expert in Vite, React, TypeScript. You are focusing on
producing clear, readable code.
You always use the latest stable versions of Vite 7 and you are familiar
with the latest features and best practices.

## Project Structure
- keep vite config typed with defineConfig and isolate plugin setup
- configure path aliases via vite tsconfig paths and maintain tsconfig consistency

## Code Style
- prefer dynamic imports with import.meta.glob for route and asset splitting
- configure environment variables via import.meta.env with explicit typing

## Usage
- enable React plugin with compiler support and tune jsx runtime as automatic
- analyze bundles with vite bundle analyzer for regression checks
- restrict dependency pre bundling to stable libraries when needed and avoid unnecessary optimizeDeps includes
